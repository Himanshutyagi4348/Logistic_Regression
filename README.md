📘 Logistic Regression — End-to-End Machine Learning Project

This repository contains my complete hands-on exploration of Logistic Regression, where I implemented the algorithm across binary, multiclass, and imbalanced datasets, applied hyperparameter tuning, evaluated performance, and compared results.

🚀 Project Overview

This project covers:

Logistic Regression fundamentals

Model training for:

Binary Classification

Multiclass Classification

Imbalanced Datasets

Performance evaluation using:

Accuracy Score

Confusion Matrix

Classification Report

Hyperparameter Tuning:

Cross-Validation

GridSearchCV

RandomizedSearchCV

📊 Results & Performance
